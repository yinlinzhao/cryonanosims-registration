# cryonanosims-registration
This program performs image registration for correlative cryo-NanoSIMS and cryoET data. Cryo-NanoSIMS and cryoET images have different resolutions, imaging areas, colors, and pixel sizes. In addition, distortion during imaging may induce changes to data features and shape, hence it is important to inspect data carefully after acquisition and understand the parameter set.
